# Hotel-data-analysis

**--Introduction--**

This dataset contains 105840 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel around the world. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were canceled.

**--Project Description--**

Downloaded the hotel data from the Kaggle. The data cleaning and visualization is done in Excel. Analysed and compared the number of bookings made between the two hotels. Created a Dashboard and provided insights and solutions for those insights.

**--Data Description--**

  a) Raw_Data - This folder contains all those excel files which were downloaded from kaggle. It contains 3 sets of data from 3 seperate years. 

  b) Images - This folder contains the image of the Dashboard.

  c) Dashboard - This folder contains the Dashboard which is done in Excel.

  d) Insights & Improvements - This folder contains the Insights got from the Dashboard and the Improvements thats should be taken in the two 
                               Hotels to increase the number of bookings.

**Solutions to improve the business**			
						
1) Firstly we have to improve the room condition as in the data we can see that the majority of the people have booked Room_Type A. So there must be some issues with the other rooms in each particular hotel.
    				
3) Secondly to improve the business we have to maximise online reach with a manager like in some websites we have to update the room condition as well as new rooms, so that people will get more attracted.
				
4) We have to try dynamic pricing of the rooms like we can decrease the price of the best booking rooms by 5%. It will surely make us profit.			
5) A hotel room or a hostel bed will be priced based on supply and demand. Room rates should generally be increased when demand exceeds supply (to capitalize on ADR) and lowered when demand is weak (to increase occupancy).						
						
6) In these 3 years we can see that the number of bookings made with the GDS distribution channel is very very less as compared to others. So we can permanently stop that channel and make new channels to make our profit increase by 30%.						
						
7) We can update the food items and the quality of the HB and FB meal packages.	Atleast the FB package should be modified as there are very less bookings.						
						
8) Rather than hiking rates or selling out quickly on busy nights, consider adding in stay restrictions such as closed-to arrival or a minimum length of stay to boost occupancy on shoulder nights.						
						
9) Aviation and Complimentary market_segments can be ignored due to less profit.						
						
10) We can add audience targeting to an ad_group or campain. So they will be responsible for bringing new guests and customers.		
						
11) We can make a system of cancellation amount which the guests have to pay if the booking is cancelled.
						
12) And lastly we can optimize our inventory. For eg now the bookings are less so we can Charge premiums for not only suites and popular rooms but also for value-added features like larger rooms, a better view, preferred bed configurations, and attributes like balconies, fireplaces, wet bars, and pool access.
